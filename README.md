# Internship-task4
Logistic Regression-based binary classifier to detect breast cancer (malignant vs benign) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Includes model training, evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC curve. Part of my AI &amp; ML Internship Task 4.
# Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

This task aims to build a binary classifier using logistic regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Steps Followed
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Train-test splitting
3. Feature standardization
4. Logistic Regression model training
5. Model evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC-AUC
6. ROC Curve plotting

## Result
Achieved 95%+ accuracy and AUC of ~0.98
